Arduino Universal Serial Adapter
================================
Everything you need to create an Arduino based serial adapter designed to work with
- Phone UART chips
- Standard DB9 serial ports
- Null modem serial ports
- Cisco serial consoles

The idea is to have 1 serial adapter that takes care of all of your DB9 / null modem / goofy pinouts in one package.
